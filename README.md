# Torus-Knot-

### **What is a Torus Knot?**
A **torus knot** is a type of mathematical knot that lies on the surface of a torus (a doughnut-shaped surface) and winds around the torus in a specific way. It is defined by two coprime integers **p** and **q**, which determine how many times the knot winds around the central hole of the torus (longitude) and how many times it passes through the hole (meridian).

In this code, the `THREE.TorusKnotGeometry` is used to generate a torus knot with specific parameters:
```js
const geometry = new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(2, 0.4, 200, 32, 3, 2);
```
- `2` → Major radius (size of the knot).
- `0.4` → Tube radius (thickness of the knot).
- `200` → Number of tubular segments (more segments make it smoother).
- `32` → Number of radial segments (defines the resolution).
- `3, 2` → **p=3, q=2**, meaning the knot winds **3 times around the torus** and **2 times through the hole**.

### **Mathematics Behind a Torus Knot**
A torus knot is defined parametrically by:

Where:
- \( t \) is the parameter that varies to create the curve.
- \( R \) is the major radius (distance from the center of the torus).
- \( r \) is the minor radius (thickness of the tube).
- \( p \) and \( q \) define the knot type (how many times it loops around).

In the code, `p = 3` and `q = 2`, which means the knot completes **3 full rotations around the torus** while passing through the hole **2 times**.

### **Other Features in the Code**
1. **Rainbow Coloring Using HSL:**
   - The color of each vertex is calculated using its index in the geometry:
   ```js
   const t = (i / positionAttribute.count) * 0.8;
   color.setHSL(t, 1.0, 0.5);
   ```
   - This creates a gradient effect where colors smoothly transition along the knot.

2. **Space-Like Background with Stars:**
   - A **particle system** is created with `THREE.Points`, where each point is a randomly placed star.
   - Colors for stars are generated using random HSL values.

3. **Lighting Effects:**
   - A `PointLight` simulates a light source, making the torus knot shiny.
   - An `AmbientLight` is used for softer, background lighting.

4. **Animation and Interaction:**
   - The knot continuously **rotates around the x and y axes**:
   ```js
   knot.rotation.x += 0.01;
   knot.rotation.y += 0.01;
   ```
   - Stars are given a slow rotation to simulate a floating effect.
